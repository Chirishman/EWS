# PowerShell Module: EWS
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bielawb/EWS/master/EWSModuleLogo.png)

EWS (Exchange Web Services) is a convenient way to manage mailboxes:
- on premise (with Exchange 2007+)
- in the cloud (Office 365)
- at home (outlook.com/live.com mailboxes)

The purpose of this module is to provide a thin wrapper around EWS objects and methods.
That way user can use familiar syntax when communicating with her/his Exchange resources.

This module is far from being feature-complete, but it should be a good starting point.

# TODO
Apart from extending functionality, there are few serious problems that need to be addressed first:
1. Testing (see #3)
2. Help - basic version created for existing commands (see #2)
3. Automatic building/ releasing/ publishing (see #4)
